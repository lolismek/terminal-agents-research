Migrating from Terminal-Bench
Migrating from Terminal-Bench to Harbor

Harbor is created by the same team as Terminal-Bench. The Harbor task format is an iteration on the format proposed by Terminal-Bench and addresses some of the limitations of the Terminal-Bench format.

The difference in file trees is shown below:

A detailed description of the differences between the two task formats is available here.

Migration Guide

Harbor provides a mapper from the Terminal-Bench task format to the Harbor task format. Note that this mapper is not perfect, and some particularly custom tasks may require manual migration.


harbor tasks migrate -i "<path/to/terminal-bench/task(s)>" -o "<path/to/harbor/task(s)>"
To understand the differences between the two task formats, see the differences page.
