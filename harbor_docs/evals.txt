Evals
Running a dataset

Harbor is built by the creators of Terminal-Bench with evals as a core use case.

What is a dataset?

In Harbor, a dataset is a collection of tasks in the Harbor task format. Tasks are agentic environments consisting of an instruction, container environment, and test script.

Datasets can be used to evaluate agents and models, to train models, or to optimize prompts and other aspects of an agent.

Viewing registered benchmarks

Harbor comes with a default registry defined in a registry.json file stored in the repository root.

To view all available datasets, you can use the following command:


harbor datasets list
Running a benchmark from the registry

To evaluate on Terminal-Bench, you can use the following command:


harbor run -d terminal-bench@2.0 -m "<model>" -a "<agent>"
Harbor will automatically download the dataset based on the registry definition (which points to version controlled task definitions).

To evaluate on SWE-Bench Verified:


harbor run -d swe-bench-verified@1.0 -m "<model>" -a "<agent>"
If you leave off the version, Harbor will use the latest version of the dataset.

Running a local dataset

If you want to evaluate on a local dataset, you can use the following command:


harbor run -p "<path/to/dataset>" -m "<model>" -a "<agent>"
Analyzing results

Running the harbor run command creates a job which by default is stored in the jobs directory.

The file structure looks something like this:


jobs/job-name
├── config.json               # Job config
├── result.json               # Job result
├── trial-name
│   ├── config.json           # Trial config
│   ├── result.json           # Trial result
│   ├── agent                 # Agent directory, contents depend on agent implementation
│   │   ├── recording.cast
